🚀 Form Validation mini Practice App using React Hook Form 🚀

I’ve just completed a Form Validation App in React, to explore the power of React Hook Form and Hooks for clean and efficient code! 🎉

Here are some key features:

🔑 Dynamic form validation – Real-time error handling for inputs like name, email, and password.
📜 Implemented pattern matching to ensure valid email inputs.
💡 Used useForm, handleSubmit, and watch to manage form state and validation easily!

I’m continually learning and practicing new skills in React, and this project was a great hands-on experience!
